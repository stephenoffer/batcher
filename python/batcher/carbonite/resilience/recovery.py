"""Shuffle recovery — the recompute-on-failure coordination loop.

When a worker is lost mid-shuffle, the partitions it held vanish and the reducers
fetching them fail. Carbonite recovers by *recomputing* those partitions on a
surviving worker (from lineage) and retrying the fetch — bounded by a policy so a
permanently broken shuffle fails loudly instead of looping forever.

Carbonite owns only the *coordination* (try, see what failed, recompute, retry,
give up); the distributed layer supplies the closures that know how to attempt the
shuffle round and how to regenerate a lost partition on a live worker. Keeping the
loop here means the policy and the give-up semantics are one tested thing, reused
by every shuffle shape.
